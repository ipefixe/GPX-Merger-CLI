# GPX-Merger-CLI

My need was to merge commuting's activities (velotaf in french), to have a cleaner Strava account and to spam the feed less.

Note: Specifically for Strava, it doesn't correctly take into account activities that are discontinuous in time and space. In time, it's not particularly problematic, the information is still detectable in the activity. But for the discontinuous in space, it will connect (in a straight line) the different segments and it counts this additional connection.

So it's worth merging activities that have identical (or very close) start and finish points, otherwise it becomes misleading and false.

## üíª Usage

`gpx-merger <paths> ... [--output <output>]`

ARGUMENTS:

- `<paths>` Paths to GPX files to merge

OPTIONS:

- `-o, --output <output>` Path to output GPX file
- `-h, --help` Show help information.

## üìù Additional information

You can merge as many files as you like.

There is no need to check that you are adding them in chronological order. They will be reordered by the script.

## üëÄ Example

```
swift run GPXMergerCLI ~/Desktop/marche-3.gpx ~/Desktop/marche-2.gpx ~/Desktop/marche-4.gpx ~/Desktop/marche-1.gpx -o ~/Desktop/ma_marche.gpx
